# Monero PocketNode

WORK IN PROGRESS.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  PR'S WELCOME!  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE ANDROID APPS.

Forked this project from an Aeon/Wownero repo.  I was able to get it running in Android Studio on a Google Pixel phone in combination with the Android ARMv8 Monerod binary.  Please feel free to replace the existing binary in the repo (monerod64) with your own. 

The app has a pretty poor/ugly yet functional existing UI, but I would like to take it in this direction from a style standpoint:

Monero node for your Android phone... Soon(tm)

## Install 

I won't be releasing APKs until this app is in decent stable shape, but for now:

- Add your own Android Monero 64/32 binaries (replace the ones currently in the repo unless you REALLLLY trust me), 
- load up Android Studio and run the debugger tool using your phone. This will install a debug version of the app on your phone.  

## Phone requirements
A 64 bit processor with 2 Gb of storage is recommended to run on the mainnet blockchain.
