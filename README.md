# Monero PocketNode - A Monero node for your Android phone.

WORK IN PROGRESS.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  PR'S WELCOME!  RECOMMEND USING ON AN OLD PHONE- NOT YOUR DAILY DRIVER.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE ANDROID APPS.

## Phone requirements
A 64 bit processor with 2 Gb of storage is recommended to run on the mainnet blockchain.

## Install 

Download Android Studio, replace the monero64/32 binaries with your own Android ARMv7/v8 binaries and generate a signed .apk.

OR

(If you trust that I haven't added nefarious binaries) Download the .apk from the latest release, and start up the app. 

1. Open settings menu
2. Optional- Check 'Use SD Card' if you have one available on your device (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
3. Check 'Start Node' to turn on the node
4. DONE

The device will likely stop syncing after going to sleep, so you may want to download an app that keeps your screen enabled: Coffee is working well for me: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.muellerma.coffee/
