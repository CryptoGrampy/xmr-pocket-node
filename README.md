# Wownero daemon

Wownero node for your Android phone. This is wownerod packaged in an Android App.


## Installation from github binaries

Make sure you enabled unknown sources in Android configuration (settings -> Security).

Download the app from the release section.



## Build it yourself

If you want to build the app yourself, the first thing is to get Wownero on github, then build binaries for arm64-v8a and armeabi, and then replace the compiled wownerod binary under res/raw.

res/raw/wownerod32 is the arm 32 bit compiled daemon, and res/raw/wownero64 is the 64 bit one.

Then import and build with android studio.  



## Phone requirements
A 64 bit processor with 2 Gb of storage is recommended to run on the mainnet blockchain.


## Wallet connection
When the node is synchronized and running, a wallet app can connect locally to check and process payements.
Running a node locally is much safer than using a public node.  


## About Monero
If you want to build this app for Monero, just replace wownerod32 and woenerod64 by there monero ones, and change ressources and name in MainActivity:copyBinaryFile. That's it!

## Tips
If your phone gets pretty hot during synchronization, go to "settings" -> "Limit rate" and set a value around 50 kB/s. This will reduce CPU usage but will make synchronization slower....
